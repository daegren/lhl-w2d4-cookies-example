# W2D4 - Cookies & User Authentication

This repo contains several branches

## [basic-cookie](https://github.com/daegren/lhl-w2d4-cookies-example/tree/basic-cookie)

This branch contains the code for using a basic cookie to store user auth info.

- You should _not_ use this to store user info

## [encrypt-passwords](https://github.com/daegren/lhl-w2d4-cookies-example/tree/encrypt-passwords)

This branch adds the code to hash the passwords so that they aren't being stored as plaintext.

## [encrypted-cookies](https://github.com/daegren/lhl-w2d4-cookies-example/tree/encrypted-cookies)

This branch makes cookies encrypted so we cannot modify the cookie directly.
